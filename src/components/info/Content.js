      <p>PlanToday is a very simple and minimal planner application.</p>
      <p>
        It allows you to plan what you are going to do on a present day and
        review what you had planned the previous day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a journal or a progress tracker as it
        doesnâ€™t save your todo's or progress. Use it to have a clear view of
        your day at hand and just focus on making the best out of it without
        worrying about any other things.

        For best experience, use it on a phone and add it on your home screen
        for easy access.
